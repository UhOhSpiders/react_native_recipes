Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li><li>Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl, pouring back into the bowl any bits of grain or other ingredients that may remain in the sifter.</li><li>Add the butter and the sugars. Beat with a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. With the mixer on low-speed, mix just until the butter and sugars are blended, about 2 minutes. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl.</li><li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until each is combined.</li><li>Mix in the vanilla.</li><li>Add the flour mixture to the bowl and blend on low-speed until the flour is barely combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl</li><li>Add the chocolate all at once and mix on low-speed until the chocolate is evenly combined. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl, then scrape the batter out onto a work surface, and use your hands to fully incorporate all the ingredients.</li><li>Scoop mounds of dough about 3 tablespoons in size onto the baking sheet, leaving 3 inches between them, or about 6 to a sheet.</li><li>Bake the cookies for 16 to 20 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until the cookies are evenly brown.</li><li>Transfer the cookies, still on the parchment, to the counter to cool. Give them a quick sprinkling with a pinch of sea salt.</li><li>Repeat with the remaining dough.</li><li>These cookies are best eaten warm from the oven or later that same day. They also keep beautifully in the freezer, either by freezing the dough or freezing the cookies once they're cooled. 20-30 seconds in the microwave is all you need to warm one up!</li></ol>",

You want them approximately half-cooked. Strain the peas and throw them directly into the pan with the pancetta adding a spoonful of the pea-water. Allow to cook until peas are cooked but still have a bite.\nTaste and adjust the seasoning with salt & pepper.\nJust before you serve, toss in the herbs and drizzle with good extra virgin olive oil.",

Shred fish with your fingers.</li><li>Pour 3 inches of water into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the diced potatoes, and cook until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain the potatoes, return them to the pan briefly. (The heat from the pan will evaporate excess moisture from the potatoes.) Mash the potatoes until smooth, then whisk in the butter.</li><li>Stir the cod into the mashed potatoes. Stir in the green onion, cilantro, olives, egg white, sesame oil, salt, garlic, ginger and pepper.</li><li>In a chilled bowl, whip the cream until it holds soft peaks. Gently fold the whipped cream into cod mixture with a rubber spatula.</li><li>Using two large soupspoons, form about 3 tablespoons of the cod-potato mixture into an oval fish cake. Set the cod cake on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining potato mixture.</li><li>Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate. Beat the egg in a wide, shallow bowl. Dip each cod cake into egg, turning it gently to coat all sides. Allow any excess egg to drip back into the bowl, then roll the cake in breadcrumbs to coat all sides. Set the coated fish cakes on a baking sheet.</li><li>Place a large skillet over medium heat and pour in 1/4 inch of vegetable oil. When the oil is hot - a corner of a cod cake will give off a lively sizzle when dipped in the oil - add as many of the fish cakes to the skillet as will fit without touching each other. (You may need to do this in two batches.) Cook, turning once, until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li><li>Remove the fish cakes with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels. If necessary, repeat with the remaining cod cakes. Serve warm.</li><li>This recipe yields 4 servings.</li></ol>",

Set aside.</li><li>Prepare your hand mixer so that it is ready when needed.</li><li>Measure milk and water into a deep heavy bottomed pan. Cut butter into smallish chunks and add them into the milk mixture. Heat gently until all the butter has melted.</li><li>Increase heat on the butter milk mixture until is comes to a rolling boil.</li><li>Remove from heat and pour flour mixture into the milk mixture all at once. Beat vigorously with a wooden spoon.</li><li>Return to a low heat and continue beating with the wooden spoon until the flour forms a smooth paste and has come cleanly off all the sides and bottom (should be shiny and smooth). The recipe says to avoid over cooking this paste as the buns will become heavy.</li><li>Remove from heat and slowly pour the egg into the mixture, beating well with the hand mixer, being careful to to make the paste too runny (the recipe indicates that the amount of egg required depends on the humidity, so add in smallish quantities). Continue to beat until shiny and stiff. The paste should firm but elastic and should be able to stand on its own when dropped by spoonfuls. This paste may be kept for a couple of hours covered with a damp cloth. Also, the recipe indicates that this paste can be frozen and used successfully (next time I will freeze excess balls individually on a cookie sheet, and bake individually as required in the future!).</li><li>Prepare a cookie sheet by running it under cold water, shaking excess water off, but leaving it damp. Use two baking sheet to protect the bottom of each puff from burning.</li><li>Place tablespoons of the mixture about 10 cm apart (the chous will double to triple in size).</li><li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the exterior is golden  do NOT open the oven for the first 15 minutes. Chou needs to be golden otherwise they will collapse as cooling. All sides must be golden brown, if not, the inside has not finished baking and they WILL collapse!</li><li>When done, remove from the sheet to a baking rack, piercing with a toothpick to allow steam to escape. Chou pastry may be reheated for about 10 minutes to crisp them up again.</li></ol>",

        "instructions": "In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add spray with a generous amount of PAM and add oil. Add mustard seeds and saute for 30 seconds-till you hear popping noises. Add curry leaves- BE CAREFUL, they pop hot oil! Add onions and peppers- sweat for about 30 seconds. Add chopped garlic, chilies and turmeric. Saute for about 5-7 minutes, until the onions and peppers are soft. Add peas and carrots mixture, cumin powder and salt. Saute for about 7-10 minutes- you want all the veggies to be soft and cooked through.\nMeanwhile in a small bowl, add the cubed tofu, a pinch of turmeric, cumin powder, coarse black pepper and some cayenne pepper (totally optional!). Mix and set aside to marinate for a bit.\nOnce the veggies are cooked, add the tofu- saute until slightly brown and soft enough that it crumbles. Add juice form half a lemon and half of the chopped cilantro. Mix and add the diced boiled potato, and toss until everything is coated, soft and taste for salt/spices. Using a masher, mash the mixture until mushy and until the veggies are small. Set aside to cool. Once cooled, add a bit of the breadcrumbs and mix with your hands. Start forming into thick patties (mixture should make 4). If its still giving you a hard time, add more breadcrumbs. Make 4 patties, place on a plate and wrap with plastic wrap until ready to use.\nIn a small skillet sprayed with PAM over medium-high heat, add one patty at a time. Cook for about 2 minutes on each side- until browned and crispy.At the same time, saute the thick slices of onion, until charred and slightly soft. Spread a generous amount of the chutney spread on each side on the bread, place burger, onions tomato and cilantro leaves. Serve with a slice of lemon and reduced-fat chips on the side.",
